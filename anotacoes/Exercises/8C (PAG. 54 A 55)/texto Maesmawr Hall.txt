Maesmawr Hall is a manor house in Powys, Wales. It was built in 1535 and today is a 20-bedroom hotel and venue for weddings. It is famous because people say it is haunted.

Many guests say that they have seen ghosts. A businessman who stayed at the hotel said that when he looked out of the window he saw hundreds of Roman soldiers marching. In fact, in Roma times there was a road which passed through the grounds of Maesmawr Hall. Other guests said they saw the ghosts of the Davies sisters who owned the hotel in the 1900s, and the ghost of an old housekeeper walking through a wall in the hall. But perhaps most frightening is the story that the gost of an evil man called Robin Drwg haunts the woods around the hotel. Some people say that they have seen this ghost suddenly change into the shape of a bull.

Maesmawr was on a TV programme about houses with ghosts called Most Haunted. The TV show presenters and investigators from the Mid Wales Paranormal (MWP) reported lots of strange activity in the hall - seeing balls of light, feeling movements, and hearing unusual sounds. During the investigation, the floor in one of the upstaris rooms moved. The hotel's current owner, Nigel Humphryson, says he often hears voices and banging noises that he cannot explain.

So if you're interested in ghosts, why not stay here? But don't go outside at night unless you're feeling really brave!
