I like the parks in Britain, especially Hyde Park in London. 
The parks are clean and some are really big, and it's great 
to go for a walk and see so many trees and plants in the 
middle of a city.
There is always something interesting to see or do, too. 
Sometimes there are festivals where you can hear music 
or watch a film. 
But I can also relax, and read a newspaper on Sunday 
morning. 
But, I don't like the food here - it's very expensive, 
and I can't find good Korean Food!
