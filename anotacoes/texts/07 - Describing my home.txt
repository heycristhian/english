My home 

House in North East Assis

My house is in a quiet neighborhood called Inocoop, in a city of the state of SÃ£o Paulo. 

In the house there are three bedrooms, one of these rooms has a privacy bathroom. 

There is also another bathroom in the middle of the house.

It has also a living room, a dining room, a kitchen, a backyard with a barbecue and a laundry.

The living room is medium size, there are two tables, two sofas, two chairs, a shelf and a TV, 
there is space for 7 people to sit.

The dining room is a little small, there is a beautiful table made of wood and glass,  
but it has space for 6 people to dinner.

Each room has a bed, a wardrobe and air conditioning for warm weather.

The kitchen is quite big, there is a frige, a stove, a table, a make coffee, a blender, an airfrayer,
a microwave, and a custom-made shelf.

The laundry room has enough space to wash your clothes, there is a silk and a washing machine.

This house is near Unip, which is an university and a highway named Raposo Tavares. 
So you can take your car and travel to other cities more easily or drive around the city.

It's a 36-minute walk from the center of city, so if you prefer to go by bus, it would be about 15 minutes.
It's a 6 minute drive from the center of city, because in this city there is not much traffic.


Where I want to go:
- Toronto, Canada.
