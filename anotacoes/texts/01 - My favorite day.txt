Hi Mr. Rodrigues, Sorry by send the text too later for you.

*MY FAVORITE DAY*

My favorite day is Saturday, because it's the day that I can to eat (junk food).

I don't need to work on weekends, that's because that I can get up at 12 or 1 o'clock on Saturdays morning, so I don't do nothing in this time. Normally I have lunch at home, typical brazilian food, like rice, bean and meat, sometimes it has french fries.
After the lunch, from about 2 to 5 o'clock I play Clone Hero or I play game with my friends. In the end of afternoon, I go to the supermarket to buy junk food, like candies and chocolates.
In the evening I bringing my girlfriend to my house and we order pizza or hot dogs for dinner, It (depends on the day).
After the great dinner, we watch Supernatural, but there was a problem, we are watching the final season and we don't know what we go to watch later to finish. Maybe The Big Bang Theory.
She sleeps first and I (keep watching) until at 5 or 6 o'clock. Then finally I sleep.
