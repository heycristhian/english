My English Story

First of all, I love that language, because everything is in English, tv, books, documentation, etc.
When I was 15 years old I wanted to do English class at the Wizzard, but my parents didn't have money.
I knew person that did English class and I envied them.
After a while I got to do English class at the Wizzard, but it wasn't like I thought. It was expensive and I didn't like its methods.
I did 6 months and gave up. I realized that it wasn't the better for me and after I started college.
At the college I was English class, but more technician. The teacher wasn't the best.
