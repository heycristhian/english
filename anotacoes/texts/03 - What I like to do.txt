What I like to do?

During the week I like to watch videos on Youtube after work, but lately I need to study English and another things of my area.
I need to read a book about a platform what I work, bacause in November I will take a test that costs 100 dollars.
After I study, I go to the gym and I stay there about 2 hours, because I need to run as well. 
Then, I go back home and I take a shower and finally I have dinner and I sleep.
On weekends I like to wake up late and sometimes I play games too, because during the week I sleep badly.
That's it.
