Favourite times 

In Brazil the best month is February. Why? Because it's the biggest party in the country called Carnaval. 
The most of people go out, drink a lot, makeup and dress like heros, fairies and more.
Practically all cities in Brazil stop to celebrate. The weather is good because the season is summer. 
Usually the plans made at the beginning of the year start after February. 
But it all ends when Easter starts and plans generally go down the drain.
Even if this happens, the Brazilian people are very happy.
